        <p>European automotive suppliers said they are refining delivery forecasts for electric vehicle programs scheduled to launch in 2027, citing more predictable battery pricing and clearer demand signals from dealers. Several firms reported that orders are now clustering around fewer, higher‑volume platforms rather than a wide mix of niche launches.</p>
        <p>Industry executives said the revised outlook reflects a sharper focus on mainstream segments where demand visibility is stronger. Manufacturers are also moving to align launch timing with charging‑network expansion and stricter emissions rules expected later in the decade.</p>
        <p>Component makers noted that customers are prioritizing long‑term supply contracts for inverters and thermal systems while delaying smaller experimental programs. The shift could reduce excess capacity in component manufacturing and improve consistency in supply planning.</p>
        <p>Analysts said full production schedules are expected to be finalized after mid‑year procurement rounds, with some programs pushing pilot builds into early 2027 to manage cost and compliance risk.</p>
