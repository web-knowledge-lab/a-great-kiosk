        <p>Coastal City FC has announced a three‑year overhaul of its academy system, aiming to improve player development and retention. The club said the changes will begin this summer with a restructured coaching hierarchy and a refreshed curriculum for every age group.</p>
        <p>The program adds two full‑time sports scientists, a dedicated goalkeeper unit, and a partnership with a local university to provide academic support for under‑18 squads. A new mentorship track will pair academy players with senior team professionals during preseason blocks.</p>
        <p>Officials said the academy will introduce standardized fitness testing, a revised match‑analysis process, and enhanced support for player welfare. The club also plans to expand scouting in regional leagues to improve recruitment coverage.</p>
        <p>Club executives said the investment is intended to reduce reliance on transfer spending and create a clearer pathway from the academy to the first team over the next two seasons.</p>
